# react-boilerplate

My take at a simple boilerplate for React.

## Uses:
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Standard.js](https://github.com/feross/standard)
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Todo:
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
* [chai-enzyme](https://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme)
* Add `dev` package script to run tests with watch and server with standard linting
* [React CSS Modules](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules)
