# react-boilerplate

My take at a simple boilerplate for React.

## Uses:
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* ES6
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

## Todo:
* [Standard.js](https://github.com/feross/standard)
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
* [chai-enzyme](https://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme)
